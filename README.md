# 👋 Greeting Everyone, I’m Sarin. 

- 👀 I’m interested in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Computational Intelligence (CI), I'm hoped my interested topics will help everyone in someday.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about the metaheuristic for path finding problem solving.

## 2026 Plan
I currently prepare to apply doctoral degree program 
- I must have IELTS 6.5 for overall bands (my native language isn't English so I must try hard to acheive those scores).

I begin the side project from a subject from my master thesis which is METAHEURISTIC for complex problem solving so I want to expand my knowledge about that to overcome the alleviated
## About Me
I've been a environmental engineer with the civil engineer field (road construction). Now that I am not manage the construction sites anymore I have decide to transform into a interesting career. Then, I have decided to enroll a master degree in computer engineering for following and fulfilling my passion.

Before the initial story of master degree, I interested in Artificial Intelligence (AI) that I recieved from many sources specifically Youtube and Facebook, they provide me the massive information about it such as How AI works, AI era, and whatever videos about AI. Therefore, I jumped in a wave of these wave which the inspired goal 

In the future, I hope my works will help everyone to find the inspiration for making new project or prototye with the metaheuristic. But even as it now, I consistently develop and research more about the interesting algorithms.
