## 👨‍💻 About Me

I began my career as an **Environmental Engineer** in the civil engineering sector, specializing in road construction and site management. After gaining valuable industry experience, I decided to pursue a career transition aligned with my passion for technology.

This led me to enroll in a **Master's program in Computer Engineering**, where I discovered my enthusiasm for Artificial Intelligence. My interest was initially sparked through various online resources—videos and articles explaining how AI works, its applications, and its transformative potential.

Inspired by this knowledge, I dove deeper into the field and focused my research on **metaheuristic algorithms** during my graduate studies.

## 🚀 Vision

I hope my work inspires others to explore metaheuristic approaches for their projects and prototypes. I am committed to continuous learning and research in optimization algorithms and computational intelligence.
